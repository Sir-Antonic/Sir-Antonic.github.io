Antonic is all about keeping the spirit of WWF No Mercy alive and kicking. Ever since I stumbled upon the endless fun this classic Nintendo 64 wrestling game offers,
I’ve been all in on creating and sharing mods that take the No Mercy experience to the next level.

What began as a simple hobby over 15 years ago has turned into a full-blown passion project, where I’ve crafted tons of custom moves.
I believe WWF No Mercy isn’t just a nostalgic blast from the past; it’s a game that can keep evolving and thrilling players for years ahead.

On this site, you’ll discover a bunch of Move Hacks and Animations, from minor adjustments to totally new moves,
all aimed at making your gameplay more exciting and unique. There’s definitely something here for every fan!
